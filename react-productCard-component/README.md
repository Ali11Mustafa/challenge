# Health 360 - React Application

Welcome to Health 360, a React application that provides information about health-related products. This README will guide you through setting up and running the app on your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the Health 360 app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-360.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd health-360
   ```

3. Install project dependencies and run the app:

   ```shell
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

This command will start the development server, and you can access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Fake API

Health 360 uses a fake API for demonstration purposes. To run the fake API server, follow these steps:

1. Start the fake API server by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```shell
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
   ```

The fake API server will be available at `http://localhost:3004`. The app will make API requests to this server to fetch product data.

Redux Setup Documentation
store.js

The store.js file is responsible for configuring your Redux store using the configureStore function from @reduxjs/toolkit. It sets up a single reducer for your application.

    configureStore: This function is used to create the Redux store. It accepts an object that specifies the reducers for different parts of your application's state. In this case, it configures a store with a single reducer for the "product" part of the state.

productCardActions.js

This file contains an asynchronous action creator called fetchProduct using createAsyncThunk from @reduxjs/toolkit. It fetches product data from an API using Axios.

    createAsyncThunk: This function creates an asynchronous action that you can dispatch to make API requests. In this case, it's used to fetch product data from the "http://localhost:5000/product" endpoint.

productCardReducer.js

The productCardReducer.js file defines a Redux slice for managing the state related to the fetched product data.

    createSlice: This function creates a Redux slice, which includes an initial state, reducer functions to handle actions, and an "extraReducers" field to handle asynchronous actions.
    The slice manages three pieces of state: product (the fetched data), status (the loading status), and error (error messages).

productCardSelectors.js

This file defines selectors for accessing the product state, status, and error in the Redux store.

    selectProduct: Returns the product data from the Redux store.
    selectProductStatus: Returns the loading status from the Redux store.
    selectProductError: Returns the error message from the Redux store.

React Application Integration
App.jsx

This is the main component of your React application. It uses Redux to fetch and display product data.

    useEffect: It uses useEffect to dispatch the fetchProduct action when the component mounts and the status is "idle." This action fetches data from the API if it hasn't been fetched yet.
    Conditional Rendering: It conditionally renders different components based on the status state:
        "loading": Displays a loading spinner (using the BeatLoader component) when data is being fetched.
        "failed": Displays an error message when there's an error during the fetch operation.
        Default: Renders the product cards when the fetch is successful.

main.jsx

This is the entry point of your React application. It renders the App component and provides it with the Redux store using the Provider component.

    Provider: The Provider component wraps the App component, making the Redux store available to all components within the app.

Summary

In summary, your Redux setup includes actions, reducers, and selectors in the productCard folder. These manage the state for fetching and storing product data. Your React application (App.jsx and main.jsx) integrates Redux to fetch and display the data, handling loading and error states as well. This setup helps you maintain a clean separation of concerns and manage your application's state efficiently.
